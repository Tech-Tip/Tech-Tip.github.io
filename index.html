<h2> Some More About Me!</h2>
<p> I have been programming for <a href="halooooo.html">3</a> years now, when I started out, I learned scratch and made professional games and programs.
After that, I have started to learn Node.js, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Java, C++, and C#! Well, thats it but make sure to keep on coding!<p><br>
